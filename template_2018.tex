	\paragraph{Abstract} The abstract must explain the idea in brief. You must write about 180-240 words related to the project you are willing to work on. Prepare the abstract after carefully researching the idea, and analyzing the possibilities of it in real world. A good abstract also briefly hints the impact factor of the project, or the amount of change your idea can bring, if implemented in real world. This section needs to be small and reflect the wide idea in the least possible number of words. Going beyond the specified number of words will result in deduction of marks for the synopsis during review. You can describe your idea in detail in the later stages. You can edit this file on your system, using a \LaTeX editor for your convenience. Please take care of the spellings and grammar. It is recommended that you include emphasized words in the keywords below. Please do not use special characters, or math/equations in the title section or abstract. If you are a team of two, delete the participant 3 details, as directed above. At the end, compile and export it as a PDF document, rename it with your team name and mail it to the organizers.
